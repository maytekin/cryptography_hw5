This program is coded with PHP 8.0. Tested and works well with both PHP 7 and PHP 8. Even though not tested, should be working well also with PHP 5 as well.

To be check the results to see if it's encoding and decoding correctly: (Also built-in "base64_encode()" "base64_decode()" functions in PHP can be used, or can be checked from terminal right away as well - might be a little tricky to deal with some special chars on the terminal.)

Validation of encoding function:
